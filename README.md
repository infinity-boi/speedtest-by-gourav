# Internet Speed Test by Gourav
### Funny thing ðŸ˜‚, I deployed this project on this link https://speedtest-gvy9.onrender.com and realized that the test will be conducted on the cloud platform, ie, Render.com that is hosting my website. Anyways, the user doesn't know ðŸ˜ˆ</h5>
### But this application can still be used to check the upload and download speed of any cloud platform or server that you are using to host your website, if you don't trust their figures.
### Tech : Python, Flask, speedtext-cli, gunicorn, html, css
## Thank you for checking out my python project
